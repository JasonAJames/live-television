                Tipping<br/>
                This one may be a no-brainer, but you should tip your server thoughtfully regardless of whether you ate a free meal or not.
                <br/><br/>
                In other words, please tip your wait-staff on the full meal price. Show your appreciation for their service. It’s the right thing to do!
